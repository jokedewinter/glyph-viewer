<h1 id="glyphviewer">Glyph Viewer</h1>

<p>A little tool to view all the glyphs in a font file.</p>

<p>The glyphs live in a json file extracted from Glyphs App and contain all the glyphs that have unicode values, grouped by category (uppercase, lowercase, figures, etc.)</p>

<p>The json file is read with vanilla JavaScript and all glyphs are placed in a grid on the page. On desktop a large version of a glyph is shown on the side when you hover over the grid of glyphs. On mobile the larger version opens up inline in the grid when you tap/click on a glyph in the grid.</p>

<p>Cobbled together with the help of a whole load of websites and view source. Thank you everyone.</p>

<p>You can view it in action here (link: https://jokedewinter.github.io/glyph-viewer/)</p>
