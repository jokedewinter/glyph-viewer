# Glyph Viewer

A little tool to view all the glyphs in a font file.

The glyphs live in a json file extracted from Glyphs App and contain all the glyphs that have unicode values, grouped by category (uppercase, lowercase, figures, etc.)

The json file is read with vanilla JavaScript and all glyphs are placed in a grid on the page. On desktop a large version of a glyph is shown on the side when you hover over the grid of glyphs. On mobile the larger version opens up inline in the grid when you tap/click on a glyph in the grid.

Cobbled together with the help of a whole load of websites and view source. Thank you everyone. 

You can view it in action here (link: https://jokedewinter.github.io/glyph-viewer/)
